      "message": "I agree such an explanation is useful, but is unrelated to current patch. I didn\u0027t change any functionality, only clarified it.\n\nrrdtool is optional, packaged in collectd-rrdtool, and the plugin is loaded in rrdtool.conf. So the main default conf does not need to load it.\n\nThe patch doing this went through lots of changes, earliest introduction of it I could find is:\n\nhttp://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/collectd.git/commit/?id\u003d1c7c5991b96218e1f4c4e72c842ee75420173633\n\nIn current (opstools) repo it appeared since initial commit. It would have been useful if the initial commit included a reference to how it was created (e.g. where it was copied from and with what other changes).",
